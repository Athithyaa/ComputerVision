% For efficiency in Matlab, it is cheaper to compute dot products between
%  unit vectors rather than Euclidean distances.  Note that the ratio of 
%  angles (acos of dot products of unit vectors) is a close approximation
%  to the ratio of Euclidean distances for small angles.
%
% distRatio: Only keep matches in which the ratio of vector angles from the
%   nearest to second nearest neighbor is less than distRatio.
